            Explore new worlds. Harness the power of AI to uncover hidden planets outside the Solar System.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our project combines machine learning, education, and citizen science to make exoplanet discovery accessible to everyoneâ€”from researchers analyzing their own data to students taking their first steps in astronomy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upload real light-curve data, experiment with AI models, and help identify planetary transits in telescope images. Together, we're building a bridge between curiosity and discovery, turning data into the stories of distant worlds.
